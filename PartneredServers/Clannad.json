    "description":"High School delinquent Tomoya Okazaki lives a seemingly dull, empty school life. Being a delinquent, he and his friend Sunohara spend most of their time either skipping school or goofing around, with no real goal or motivation in their lives: just a repetitive routine.\n\nBut one day, Tomoya meets a girl named Nagisa Furukawa,  a girl whose life will soon surround his own whether he wanted it or not. Alongside Nagisa, Tomoya befriends several others, and through this he learns that his life isn't as dull as what he thinks. He soon will know that his fateful meeting with Nagisa and friends was just the start of an amazing journey.\n\n\"And so we begin... the long, long uphill climb.\"\n\nWelcome to the CLANNAD server, we're a small but passionate group of fans eager to build an active and inviting community.
