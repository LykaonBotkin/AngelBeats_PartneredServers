Being the carefree girl that she is, she quickly signs up. However, Yui has a problem, she is unable to play an instrument.\n\nWhen Yui goes to the clubroom to explain, she's greeted by the other members: Ritsu, Mio and Tsumugi. Although disheartened at Yui\u2019s lack of musical know-how, they still try to convince her to stay to prevent the club\u2019s disbandment. After playing Yui a short piece which re-ignites her imagination, they succeed in keeping their new member and guitarist.\n\nAlong with the tasks of school and homework, Yui begins to learn the guitar with the help of the other band members, experiencing many mishaps along the way.
